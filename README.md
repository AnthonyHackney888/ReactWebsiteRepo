# ReactWebsiteRepo
A react website to act as another version of my Resume.

# Creating the Website
Created the website using the pre built react website as a foundation. 
* [Install method](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) -npm install -g create-react-app , create-react-app test-project , cd test-project npm start. All from the command line, or from the command line within VScode.

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - to use as the IDE for the website. 

# Language used

* [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Javascript was used as the main language as well as its many different frameworks
* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) - The HTML portion of the website is going unused to make way for the React portion of the website
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - CSS is used throught the website to add styling to React files

# Framework Used
* [React-Router-Dom](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - used the React-Router-Dom framework to implement dynamic routing within the website

* [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) - used reactJS as the main framework to create the main content of the website


# Hosting the website
* [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com) - I used Github Pages as a way to host the site.
